### Quick Start for `yt-dlp` on Windows
- Install Latest Stable Python3
- Install Pip
Work on project within a `(venv)`, or other Python Virtual Env. To "containerize" required Python libraries. Libraries like the `yt-dlp` library we're using for running this script (***Optional but Highly Recommended***).
- Replace `video_url` in `main.py` to the YouTube video link to download.
- When run, this will create a `downloads` directory in the root of your project and place the media there.
- If no `downloads` directory exists, the script will auto-create
